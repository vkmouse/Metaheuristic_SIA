## Metaheuristic algorithms for the service-to-interface assignment for IoT system management
This code implements three metaheuristic algorithms, simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), and search economics (SE) respectively, and four rule-based algorithms, hill climbing (HC), first come first service (FCFS), Rand-Init-Allocation (RIA), and Average-Cost-Allocation (ACA) to solve the service-to-interface assignment (SIA) problem for IoT system management.

### Introduction
[Search economics (SE)](https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2015.447) is a novel metaheuristic algorithm proposed in 2015. The two main differences between SE and traditional metaheuristic are dividing the search space and investing computation resource depending on the potential of each subspace. The simulated results show that the [SESIA](https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2796310) is able to find a better solution than the HC, FCFS, [RIA](https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2016.2535163), [ACA](https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2016.2535163), SA, and GA compared in this paper.
